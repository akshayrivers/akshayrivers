### *what is conviction?* ###

—  **AN IDIOT**

<p align="center">· · · · · · · · ·</p>



 *A propos of the Wet Snow*  
 When from dark error's subjugation  
 My words of passionate exhortation  
 Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;  
 And writhing prone in thine affection  
 Thou didst recall malediction  
 The vice that had encompassed thee:  
 And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting  
 By recollection's torturing flame,  
 Thou didst reveal the hideous setting  
 Of thy life's current ere I came:  
 When suddenly I saw thee sicken,  
 And weeping, hide thine anguished face,  
 Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,  
 At memories of foul disgrace.

— **NEKRASSOV** (translated by Juliet Soskice)
